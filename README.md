# Pokemon-Shiny-Hunting-Utility

The Shiny Hunting Utility was made for ease of calculating the odds of getting a shiny Pokemon through a few methods, and tracking the progress of your hunts. This is a simple assisstant for hunters to use, and is very straight forward, but a Wiki located here on Github is being developed to assist those looking for an explanation and assistance.

Please report bugs as soon as you find them!
